# Data manipulation with SQL
Data manipulation to analyze the dataset called the "imdb_top_1000" table, which contains information about the top movies and TV shows. SQL queries were run to obtain various information: from counting movies by genre and average scores by director to counting movies released by year and finding movies with the highest number of votes and gross revenues. In addition, the average length of films per certificate was calculated, providing a detailed view of the dataset for further analysis and visualizations.
